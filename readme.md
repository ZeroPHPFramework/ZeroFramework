## Note

This project is inspired by Laravel, embracing the elegance and structure it brings to modern web applications. However, it's built with a unique twist—focusing on native PHP and avoiding external libraries. This approach takes cues from the simplicity and efficiency found in many European applications, where clean, self-sufficient code takes the lead.

Expect a blend of powerful functionality and minimalistic design—perfect for developers who love raw, unpolished PHP with a modern edge.
